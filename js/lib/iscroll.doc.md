This is the documentation for iscroll,iscroll-lite,ng-iscroll used in this project.

We use iscroll 4.2.5 intergated with ng-scroll to provide scrolling effect in our application.

iscroll is the original version [4.2.5](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/tree/v4.2.5)

ng-iscroll is from my fork(https://github.com/michalliu/ng-iScroll). See [demo](//TODO).
